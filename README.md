## My name is Antoine Ghilissen

... I am a geologist :hammer_and_pick: turned data scientist :computer:.

I have been working for nearly 10 years and have always been working much closer to data than my fellow colleagues. :nerd_face: Centralising data and consolidating a database was one of my first professional tasks and since then I've gone down the rabbit hole.

The game changer was to complete the Flatiron School data science bootcamp in early 2020. It has connected so many dots!

I have:

* learned to program in python. Which is great as I hate doing the same thing over and over again. I'd rather spend one hour automatising the problem pipeline than spend 20 minutes working on the solution every time the problem needs solving.
* learned to use statistical tools more efficiently. Also great as it really helps understanding problem better when metrics and tests are carefully selected.
* perfected my story telling skills. The way a message is delivered is sometimes even more important than the message itself.
* <details open><summary>discovered a lot of fun tools/concepts to play with such as:</summary><ul>A/B testing</ul><ul>Agile methodology</ul><ul>Cloud computing like AWS or Google Cloud Platform</ul><ul>Fraud Detection</ul><ul>GitHub</ul><ul>Jupyter Notebooks</ul><ul>Natural Language Processing</ul><ul>Visualisation libraries</ul><ul>Web scraping</ul>
