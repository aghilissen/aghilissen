## My name is Antoine Ghilissen...
... I am a geologist :hammer_and_pick: turned data scientist :computer:.

I have been working for 10 years and have always been working much closer to data than my fellow colleagues :nerd_face:. Centralising data and consolidating a database was one of my first professional tasks (geology, you say) and since then I've gone down the rabbit hole.

The game-changer was to complete the Flatiron School data science bootcamp in early 2020; it has connected so many dots!

During that bootcamp, I have:

* learnt to program in python and SQL. Which is great as I hate doing the same thing over and over again. I'd rather spend one-hour automatising the problematic pipeline than spend 20 minutes working on the solution every time the problem needs solving.
* learnt to use statistical tools more efficiently. Also great as it greatly helps understanding problems better when metrics and tests are carefully selected.
* perfected my storytelling skills. The way a message is delivered is sometimes even more important than the message itself.
* <details><summary>discovered a lot of fun tools/concepts to play with such as:</summary><ul>A/B testing</ul><ul>Agile methodology</ul><ul>Cloud computing such as Amazon Web Services (AWS) or Google Cloud Platform (GCP)</ul><ul>Fraud Detection</ul><ul>GitHub</ul><ul>Jupyter Notebooks</ul><ul>Natural Language Processing (NLP)</ul><ul>Visualisation libraries</ul><ul>Web scraping</ul>

Feel free to have a look at my projects and let me know what you think!

**Enjoy!**
